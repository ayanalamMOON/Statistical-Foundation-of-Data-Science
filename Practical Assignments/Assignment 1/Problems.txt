Problem 1: Compute (a) mean, (b) median, and (c) age-weighted mean of income. Ignore
NaNs where appropriate. Explain when a weighted mean is preferable.
Problem 2: Standardize income (z-score). Report how many incomes are outliers using rule |z|
> 3. Handle NaNs correctly (do not drop entire rows unnecessarily).
Problem 3: Create age bins: [18-25), [25-35), [35-45), [45-60) and compute for each bin:
● count of observations,
● mean income,
● median score.
Show result as a tidy DataFrame sorted by age bin.
Problem 4: Create an array it cannot be of 1 Dimension. And then showcase the operation for
the following:
● Shape and Resize → shape, size, Transpose, Flatten
● Showcasing negative indexing and display error while doing slicing
● Arithmetic Operations → Broadcasting, Dot Product
● Linear Algebra → Determinant, Inverse
